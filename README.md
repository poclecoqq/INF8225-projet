# A comparative study of GANs and VAEs for face generation
This is the code we used to write a short paper for a class project.


- `model_training.ipynb` contains the code we used to train the GANs and VAEs on Anime Faces and CelebA. 
- `metrics.ipynb` contains the code we used to evaluate the quality of the images generated by the generative models
